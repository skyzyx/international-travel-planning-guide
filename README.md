# International Travel Plan Template

Hi! My name is Ryan. 👋🏻

I live in the USA 🇺🇸. Despite being able to travel to Mexico 🇲🇽 and Canada 🇨🇦 easily for a long time (and do!), I've finally reached a point in my career where I've been able to save enough to travel to Europe, Japan, and other places.

While my template has evolved over the years, and will likely continue to evolve as I experience traveling to more places, I want to say thanks 🙏🏻 to [37signals](https://37signals.com) and their [Backpack](https://basecamp.com/handbook/05-product-histories#backpack) 🎒 product which inspired me to create the first version of this template back in the mid-2000s.

## My template

See 👉 [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md) 👈 for the template itself, and the `examples/` folder for some (past) example trips where I’ve applied this template.

This is the _template_ that I use to plan my travel, which lately has been more international travel. I include additional information for people who are less experienced in traveling than I am, for when friends/family travel with me. If you're planning a domestic trip, you can strip-down this template. If you're planning a complex international trip, you may add a few things.

Again, _this is a template_ that helps **me**. You are free to take this template and adapt it for **yourself**. If you have good ideas, feel free to open a pull-request.

## 🇺🇸 Dear American Travelers

Broad strokes here, but:

* When you are in a different country, **YOU** are the "foreigner". The word "foreigner" DOES NOT mean "not American". It just means someone who is here from someplace else. When an American travels to a different country, the American becomes the foreigner.

* Honor the customs of that country, instead of trying to make them bend to what you’re used to. Don't be a dick.

* Not every country speaks English. Learn [how to pronounce some key phrases in the language used in that country](https://translate.google.com). While some countries speak English as a _second_ or _third_ language, take the time to learn the language of the place you’re visiting.

* No, people in other countries **DO NOT** accept U.S. dollars. They have [their own money for their own country](https://currency.world/exchange_rates/all), and it's not usually 1:1 the same value as U.S. dollars. If you don't understand different currencies, exchange rates, and how they change regularly, go to your local bank and ask them to explain it to you.

* Tipping culture is different in different countries. Learn about tipping culture for where you're visiting before you go. Don't expect it to be the same as in the US.

* Sales tax is calculated differently in different countries. Learn about sales tax for where you're visiting before you go. Don't be surprised when it's different from the US.

## Recommendations

* COVID-19 is not only real, but it can kill. Take sensible precautions, and get vaccinated. Viruses don't care about your political views or fears of governments.

* Don't trap travel information inside your brain. Get it out of your brain and into a format that all travelers can use.

* If traveling with another person, have some way to sync changes to everyone's device. On iOS, I use _Apple Notes_ because it does those things, and is simple to use.

* Apps that keep track of flight/travel details can be useful. [Trip It](https://www.tripit.com), [Kayak](https://www.kayak.com), and apps like [Flighty](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1358823008) can be helpful. Most require a subscription for real-time data access and updates. Even subscribing for a month could be worthwhile.

* If anything is a file — confirmation emails, event tickets, whatever — I use a shared _iCloud Drive_ folder (inside the _Files_ app). Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Evernote, and other solutions may work just as well. Make sure that all travelers can use the same thing.

* SIM cards (including eSIMs) in other countries might be data-only. You'll need a way to communicate with your fellow travelers. iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, Signal, Telegraph — just make sure that all travelers can use the same thing. International calling and SMS text messages through your home carrier can create a surprise bills!

    * iPhones 14 Plus/Pro/Max are _eSIM-only_ when sold in the US. These models no longer have a physical SIM card slot. Plan accordingly.

* If you’re traveling long distances to a multi-hour jump from your home timezone, it definitely makes sense to schedule some _chill time_. Netflix is available in most countries, but the content selection will be different in different countries, even with your home login information. Don't expect Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Disney+, or other providers to be available there. Be happily surprised if they are.

* In _Apple Maps_, you can create and share _guides_, which is a collection of locations. I like to take every address/location we expect to visit on the trip, add them to a guide, and share the guide with my fellow travelers. It makes it easy for any person to find important places on the trip.

* _Apple Photos_ supports _shared photo albums_. Create the album, invite your fellow travelers, and each person can take photos and [add them to the shared album](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202786).

## Other details

* Links and information in the template will likely be US-centric (because that's what _I_ need).

* I like some balance between _scheduled_ and _unscheduled_ plans. If there are specific things that _need_ to be scheduled, I schedule them and add their times to my travel plans. Otherwise, I'll just add some cool things to do, and we can decide when we get there what we feel like doing.

* I try to explain concepts (e.g., time zones, electrical adapters) for my fellow (generally American) travelers.

    > **CONTEXT FOR THOSE OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA:** The U.S. is a big place, and North America is surprisingly homogenous compared to other parts of the world. Many Americans never leave the U.S. because it's so big and _they don't need to_. Sometimes, however, the result is that we never have to think about different power plugs, currencies, or more than a few hours of time zones. English is by far the dominant language, with Spanish coming in second, and French in third across North America. And several telecommunications companies have _North America_ plans with calling and data while traveling to Canada and Mexico.
